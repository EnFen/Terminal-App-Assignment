Ideas
1. Ledger app (app which stores user expense history against known accounts).✓✓✓✓
2. ROYGBIV Screensaver (animation that changes colour and bounces all over the screen)⤫
3. Shopping cart.(adds items, quantities, costs, and then provides a summary of shopping cart contents)✓
4. (currency converter overlay for shopping websites)⤫




Design (Ledger App)
We have chosen to proceed with the Ledger app, because it would best show the Ruby skills we have learned so far

We want it to have the following. 
* Date of transaction.
* The account the transaction has occurred.
* The amount spent.
* Save values between sessions.
* Uses OOP.
Out of scope (possible future extensions to functionality)
* Double entry accounting
* case/numeric/spelling detection
* multiple users (or multiple accounts)
* acessibility features
* link to a budget to see whether account values have exceeded or met expectations
* Include "change and delete" functionality for transactions

Ethical/Legal/Cultural Considerations
* Give credit for code snippets where appropriate
* Consider privacy of users when storing financial information - this will be stored in a plain text file!!
