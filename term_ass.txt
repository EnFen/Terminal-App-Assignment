Design (Leger App)
We have chosen to proceed with the Ledger app, we want it to have the following. 
* Date of transaction.
* The account the transaction has occurred.
* The amount spent.
* Save values between sessions.
* Uses OOP.
Out of scope.
* Double entry accounting
* case/numeric/spelling detection
