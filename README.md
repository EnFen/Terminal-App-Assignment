Ledger App

### Purpose of the App
* The app provides a way of tracking expenses across many accounts
* Users can recall expense history to see if their spending behaviour meets expectations

### Functionality
* The Ledger App can be run through a console application
* We have tested this in UNIX terminal

### Instructions for Use
#### Required third-party software for app
requires 'terminal-table' gem
requires 'colorize' gem
####Using the Ledger App
1. Using UNIX terminal, navigate to the 'src' directory, and run the 'ledger_app.rb' file with Ruby
2. The app should provide prompts for user input:
    * Dates provided to the app should be in dd/mm/yy format
    * Account categories provided to the app can be in any format (In future this should be changed to alphabeticat characters only)
    * Transaction values provided to the account should be in integer or float format
3. User should be able to use the app through the options menu until they wish to leave, however 'Ctrl/Command + C' can be used to force shutdown
